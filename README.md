# Amin Rezaei

**Lead AI Engineer | Software Architect | Researcher**

I am a software engineer and AI researcher with over a decade of experience in **Computer Vision, Generative AI (RAG), and Distributed Systems**. My focus is on architecting scalable software solutions and leading technical teams to bridge the gap between theoretical research and production deployment.

Currently, I serve as a **Lead AI Engineer** and **Peer Reviewer**, where I focus on system architecture and validating cutting-edge research. I have also been admitted to the **Ph.D. program in Intelligent Systems at the University of Pittsburgh** (currently in visa processing).

## 👨‍💻 Technical Leadership & Mentorship

Beyond individual contribution, I am passionate about building strong engineering cultures and mentoring the next generation of developers.

*   **Team Leadership:** Currently leading AI engineering initiatives at tech companies, overseeing the full lifecycle of AI product development from data pipelines to deployment.
*   **Mentorship:** Actively mentoring students and junior developers in **Artificial Intelligence**. I guide mentees through complex problem-solving in AI projects, helping them translate research concepts into working solutions.
*   **Academic Instruction:** Taught undergraduate courses in **Operating Systems, Data Structures, and Advanced Programming** at Yazd University and Technical & Vocational University.
*   **Research Review:** Serving as a **Peer Reviewer for Microsoft** (The 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Computer, Data Sciences and Applications), contributing to the rigorous evaluation of new studies in the field.
